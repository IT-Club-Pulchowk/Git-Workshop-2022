Here’s Messi, away from 2, 3, 4.. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! How good is he! A mere supernatural goal from Lionel Messi, He has wriggled and tiptoed his way to the gates of Wembley Stadium. He is just brilliant. Best player in the world bar none.

The menacing man arrives and sinks his flaming spear into the hearts of Real Madrid. Astonishing from Messi. All the pieces falling into place. Messi, born into the crossfire hurricane and he is Jumpin’ Jack Flash.

Messi. Messi. Messi. Immens Messi. Encara Messi. Encara Messi. ANKARA MESSI. Encara Messi. Encara Messi. ⠀ 
Gol. Gol. Gol. Gol. Gol. Gol. Gol. Gol. Gol.

Whaaaaaat... Are you kidding me?? This man is absolutely mainline to pure footballing magic that belongs in a different Galaxy altogether. He emasculates them individually, collectively, he literally disperses his atoms inside of his body on one side of this defender and then collects them on the other.

Lionel Messi, Futbol Heritage.
